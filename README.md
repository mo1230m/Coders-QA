# Q&A Website
A simple Q&A website built for my CS50 - Introduction to Computer Science course.

# What is this website for?
* It's for asking any coding-related questions! Whether they are about any specific language, setting up your dev environment, or anything else, please feel free to use this website for it.

* I wanted to make a website where coders (mostly beginners-intermediate learners) can ask each other any coding-related questions.

* I used Python (Flask) for backend, SQLite3 for database, HTML & CSS and Bootstrap for frontend. I'm planning to add new features soon like: upvote & downvote, search, user control panel and more.
