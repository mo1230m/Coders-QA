Welcome to ASK ME! It's a Q&A website for coders of all levels.

What is this website for?
It's for asking any coding-related questions! Whether they are about any specific language, setting up your dev environment, or anything else, please feel free to use this website for it.

I wanted to make a website where coders (mostly beginners-intermediate learners) can ask each other any coding-related questions.

I used Python (Flask) for backend, SQLite3 for database, HTML & CSS and Bootstrap for frontend. I'm planning to add new features soon like: upvote & downvote, seach, user control panel and more.
